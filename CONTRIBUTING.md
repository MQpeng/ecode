# Contributing

Thanks for contributing! Please follow these steps:

- Fork the repo and create a branch named `feat/your-feature` or `fix/short-description`.
- Run `pnpm install` then `pnpm bootstrap`.
- Place unit tests under each package's `tests/` directory (e.g. `packages/foo/tests/`). Run `pnpm test` to execute them.
- Add tests and ensure `pnpm test` passes.
- Keep changes small and focused. Add documentation when adding public APIs.
- Open a pull request to `main` and describe the changes.
